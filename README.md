## FAQ
### What is this?
Its a way to hold Barcodes or QR Codes for colleague discounts* to put it very simply.<br>
**but it can be used for any barcode/qr code*
### Why did you make this?
At where I work, we have the issue of not having enough discount barcodes so everyone on the shop floor could have one. As a result, we either have to keep chasing people around to getting them, or we have to go through our gallery to scan it.<br><br>
This is great if you don't take many photos, however I am not normal and take too many photos, so it takes a long time for me to go through it
### Ok. How do I add a Barcode?
Simply click the + icon, scan the barcode/qr code and add a label to it. It should then show in your list of barcodes.
### I'm worried about security.
Other than potentially for analytical purposes, no data is stored on our servers. It's all locally stored in your browser on the device using LocalStorage.
### Can I sync to another device?
You're unable to sync at real time at the moment. However, you are able to import and export codes by going to settings.
